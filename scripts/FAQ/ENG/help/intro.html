Skynet ++ is a scripting language written in pure Blitz3D, without using third-party libraries.<br><br><br>


Skynet ++ syntax provides flexible functional programming. It does not contain OOP, but otherwise it simplifies the scripting process as much as possible. The internal organization of the virtual machine and the API also makes it very easy and quick to embed it into any program written in Blitz3D.<br><br>


It is primarily aimed at those who need to ensure the flexibility of their program by executing simple blocks of code.<br><br><br>



Key features: <br> <br>

<ul>
<li> <u> Simple syntax. </u> Contains all familiar keywords. Some of them have changed, but in general the syntax is similar to many other programming languages. </li>
<li> <u> High performance </u>. The virtual machine is focused on executing instructions as quickly as possible. </li>
<li> <u> Dynamic (not strong) </u> typing of variable values. </li>
<li> <u> Dynamic arrays. </u> You can create, delete and add elements to arrays using the functions supplied in the base library. And also pass arrays as regular data types. </li>
<li> <u> Built-in preprocessor. </u> </li>
<li> <u> Instancing mechanism. </u> It allows processing different datasets with one script. Thus, memory consumption is significantly reduced. no need to download multiple identical scripts. This can be useful when, for example, you need to handle AI behavior in a game. Instead of loading a script for each bot, you simply create a behavior script object (instance). </li>
<li> <u> Ability to load a script directly from text into memory. </u> It is also possible to compile a script into a binary file that loads faster. The compiler also monitors possible syntax errors and notifies about variable name conflicts. </li>
<li> <u> Built-in garbage collector for arrays. </u> It automatically removes arrays that have been "lost" during code execution. </li>
</li> <u> Having a core library </u> which contains everything you need, such as math functions, functions for working with strings and arrays. </li>
</ul>
